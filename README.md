## Pointers
The `*` character before a pointer name refers to the value stored at that memory address.

The `&` character before a variable name refers to the pointer which that variable is stored in.


## Program structure
### Imports
Use `#import` to import libraries. The most common ones are:
```c
#import <stdio.h>
#import <stdlib.h>
```

### Structs & typedefs
Begin the file with structs and typedefs

### Prototypes
You should have the function prototypes before the main method. These describe the shape of the function, ie its name, its arguments and its return type.

### Main method
The main method should return 0 for a successful exit code

### Function definitions
Here you should define the code for the function prototypes declared earlier. These are used in the main method.
